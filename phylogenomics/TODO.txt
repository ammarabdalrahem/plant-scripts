1) workout stable id from cluster content, so it is reasonable stable

1.1) IDEA 1
1.1.1) produce a list of ordered core markers/genes along chrs -> how to be sure they will be core in the future?
1.1.2) for each cluster, find the closest marker both sides and define interval
1.1.3) number clusters per interval

1.2) IDEA 2
1.2.1) compute N most frequent 21-mers in cluster
1.2.2) work out cluster id from kmer composition

1.3) IDEA 3
1.3.1) Use previous clusters to compare to new and reuse stable ids as much as possible
